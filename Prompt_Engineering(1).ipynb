            " 3. Hydropower: Generated by using electricity generators to capture the energy from falling or fast-moving water. This renewable source can come from various ways, including a large dam on a river, tidal or wave energy from the ocean, or using small scale turbines in streams.\n",
            " 4. Geothermal Energy: This type of energy is generated from the heat deep within the Earth. This heat can be used directly for heating buildings or to generate electricity. It is continuously produced inside the Earth and is nearly as reliable as the tides.\n",
            " 5. Biomass Energy: Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it contains stored energy from the sun. This energy can be burned directly or converted into biofuel which can burn more efficiently.\n",
